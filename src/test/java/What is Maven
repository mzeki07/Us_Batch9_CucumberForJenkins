How many ways of adding a library to our project did we learn?
2 (Java, Maven with intellij)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st way -> We go to the official web pages of each library(etc. Selenium) and
download the libraries and add them to our project one by one. Keeping all libraries updated and finding and adding them to our project
take too much time and very difficult
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd way -> Instead of going to the web pages of all libraries we use maven with intellij. IntelliJ finds all the libraries
downloads and adds them to our project. This is also not practical.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3rd way -> WE prepare the list of the libraries we need, give to maven as pom.xml file, maven downloads all libraries for us
